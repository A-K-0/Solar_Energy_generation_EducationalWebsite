## üö∂ How to Use the Prediction Tool (Quick Guide)

Generating a prediction is easy and takes just a few clicks!

### **1. Select Location**
Click anywhere on the map of India. The system instantly detects the coordinates and populates the **Location, Latitude, and Longitude** fields.

### **2. Review Weather Data**
The system automatically fetches and displays up-to-the-second weather data for your selected location:
* üå°Ô∏è **Temperature** (e.g., $0^{\circ}C$)
* üíß **Humidity** (e.g., $0\%$)
* üåßÔ∏è **Precipitation** (e.g., $0\ mm$)
* ‚òÄÔ∏è **Solar Radiation** (e.g., $0\ W/m^2$)
* ‚ö° **Solar Energy** (e.g., $0\ kWh/m^2$)
* ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Cover** (e.g., $0\%$)
* üí¶ **Dew Point** (e.g., $0^{\circ}C$)

### **3. Generate Prediction**
Click the green **"Predict Solar Generation"** button to feed the real-time weather data into our advanced SVR machine learning model.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Developer & Setup Notes

For running or deploying this project, please ensure you handle the API keys and endpoints correctly.

### üîë Visual Crossing API Key
The application **must** have a valid API key to fetch weather data.

* **Action:** Obtain a key from **visualcrossing.com** and make sure to **replace the placeholder/default key** in your backend code (where the API is called) with your own valid key.

### üåê ML API Hosting (ngrok)
The frontend calls the backend API to get the prediction.

* **Setup:** The current setup uses **ngrok** to create a temporary public URL for the Django backend hosting the SVR model.
* **Crucial Step:** Since ngrok URLs expire and change, if you are running this project locally, you must:
    1.  Start your Django backend.
    2.  Start ngrok to expose your backend port (e.g., `ngrok http 8000`).
    3.  **Update the API endpoint URL** in your React frontend code to use the **current, public ngrok URL** so the website can communicate with the ML model.
* **Production Note:** For a permanent, production deployment, replace the ngrok setup with a stable public cloud hosting solution.
